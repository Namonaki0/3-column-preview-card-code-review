## My process
I started with a outlining the content using Bootstrap. It was a very quick and easy way for me to get responsive and reliable columns. Then I went through adding the styles to text and backgrounds. I designed the buttons with a nice hover swap of background, color, and added border.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how quickly Bootstrap can be used for a basic structure of a page like this. This foundationary understanding is really starting to click with me.


### Continued development

As much as I like Bootstrap, I know there are stronger ways of creating this layout. I want to learn better alternatives.
